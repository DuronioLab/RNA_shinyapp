# Quick Start:
## Run Paired-end RNA-seq Pipeline
### Clone pipeline (Current stable version)
git clone https://github.com/DuronioLab/RNAseq-pipeline/tree/MN_shiny.git

Carefully follow the README

The output of the RNA-seq pipeline is a tarball of all the necessary data and scripts.

## Running the app

- Uncompress the tar.gz file.
- Open startup.R in R studio.
- Highlight all text and press "ctrl + enter" or "cmd + enter".

- Alternatively, press the "Run App" button at the top of the script window.

# Troubleshooting
When running, if an error occurs or it is re-run after a partial run it may be necessary to clear the R environment. Variables and tables generated during previous runs will not be overwritten in this version.
